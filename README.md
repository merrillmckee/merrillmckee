- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @merrillmckee https://www.linkedin.com/in/merrillmckee/

### October 2024

I am open to work with a preference for Python development that includes work in computer vision, image processing, and machine learning.

Personal projects
- [lightning-ai-demonstration](https://github.com/merrillmckee/lightning-ai-demonstration)
  - A Jupyter `hello-world` image classification presentation that goes from beginning to end and will even leverage a GPU if available
- semantic-segmentation-project
- registering images with SIFT/KAZE keypoints and RANSAC

Python
- [unit testing with `unittest` and `pytest`](https://github.com/merrillmckee/unit-testing)
- looping: for loops, list comprehensions, mapping, and numpy vectorization
- concurrency: `async` and synchronous functions
- multi-threading and multi-processing

Python libraries
- `numpy` vectorization and broadcasting
- `fastapi` endpoint and Swagger interface

Learning
- [fork of code for book `Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn` by Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/merrillmckee/machine-learning-book)
- [fastapi-playground](https://github.com/merrillmckee/fastapi-playground)
- scipy-playground
- [scikit-image-playground](https://github.com/merrillmckee/scikit-image-playground)

3D
- 3D point clouds and meshes as a numpy npz, ply, and gltf
  
GCP
- TBD

### May 2021

Python object detection of NBA players and court features using Yolov5 on custom dataset.  Then I will use these features to transform to a top-down view (coach's whiteboard) of the players and basketball.
